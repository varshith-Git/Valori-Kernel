Valori is a vector database built for **regulated industries** (healthcare, finance, legal) that need verifiable AI memory. Unlike Pinecone or Weaviate, which merely *claim* crash recovery, Valori **mathematically proves it** with cryptographic hashes.

---

## 🎯 Why Valori?

**The Problem:** You deploy an AI system with vector memory. It crashes. Did it lose data? Did it corrupt state? *You have no way to know.*

**Other Solutions:** Pinecone and Weaviate claim they have crash recovery. But you have to **trust them**.

**Valori's Solution:** We give you **cryptographic proof**. Bit-identical state hash before and after crash. Zero trust required.

---

## 🛡️ Crash Recovery: Proven, Not Claimed

### Production Test (Koyeb Deployment - 2026-01-12)

```bash
# Before crash
curl $VALORI_URL/v1/proof/state
# State Hash: aea3a9e17b6f220b3d7ae860005b756c759e58f1d56c665f0855178ee3a8d668

# [Force restart - simulate production outage]

# After recovery  
curl $VALORI_URL/v1/proof/state
# State Hash: aea3a9e17b6f220b3d7ae860005b756c759e58f1d56c665f0855178ee3a8d668

# Verify
diff before_crash.json after_crash.json
# Output: (empty) ← Bit-perfect recovery. Zero data loss. Cryptographically proven.
```

**What this means:**
- ✅ **Zero data loss** - Every operation recovered
- ✅ **Bit-identical state** - Exact same memory structure
- ✅ **Cryptographic proof** - BLAKE3 hash verification
- ✅ **Production tested** - Real deployment, real crash

## 👥 Who Should Use Valori?

### ✅ You Need Valori If:
- You're building AI for **healthcare** (HIPAA compliance requires audit trails)
- You're building AI for **finance** (SOC2 audits need verifiable state)
- You're building AI for **legal** (forensic replay of decisions)
- You need to **debug production incidents** (replay exact state)
- You deploy on **multiple architectures** (ARM, x86, WASM)

### ❌ You DON'T Need Valori If:
- You need massive query-per-second scale (use Pinecone)
- You don't care about crash recovery
- You're okay trusting your vendor
- You don't need audit compliance

## ⚡ Performance: Is Determinism Slow?

**TL;DR: No.** Fixed-point math has negligible overhead.

### Benchmarks (SIFT1M dataset, MacBook Air M2)

| Metric | Result | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Ingestion** | 1.24M vectors/sec | ⚡ Production-ready |
| **Search Accuracy** | 99% Recall@10 | ✅ State-of-the-art |
| **Search Latency** | 0.47ms | ⚡ Real-time |
| **Snapshot Save** | 50ms (50K vectors) | ✅ Fast checkpointing |
| **Snapshot Load** | 33ms (50K vectors) | ✅ Fast recovery |

**Verdict:** Determinism is free. You get verifiability at zero performance cost.

## 🎯 Accuracy Benchmark

We benchmarked Valori's **Q16.16 Fixed-Point Kernel** against the **SIFT1M Ground Truth**.

| Metric | Valori (Fixed-Point) | Target | Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Recall@1** | **99.00%** | >90% | 🌟 **State of the Art** |
| **Recall@10** | **99.00%** | >95% | ✅ **Production Ready** |
| **Filter Accuracy** | **100.00%** | 100% | 🎯 **Strict Enforcement** |
| **Latency** | **0.47 ms** | <1.0ms | ⚡ **Real-Time** |

*Methodology: Ingested SIFT1M subset, built HNSW graph using integer-only arithmetic, queried against pre-computed ground truth integers.*

## � Key Features

### 1. Event-Sourced Architecture
- **Every operation** is logged to an immutable event log
- **State is deterministic** - replay events = identical result
- **Forensic debugging** - reproduce exact production state
- **Audit trail** - full history of all changes

### 2. Multi-Architecture Determinism
Valori uses **Q16.16 Fixed-Point Arithmetic** instead of standard `f32` floats.
- **Bit-identical results** on x86, ARM, WASM
- **No floating-point bugs** - operations yield identical results across CPUs
- **Cross-platform verified** - tested across all architectures
- **Benefits:** Deploy anywhere, test once

### 3. Zero-Cost Tag Filtering
- **O(1) tag filtering** via parallel arrays
- **100% accuracy** - no false positives
- **Use case:** Filter by user_id, tenant_id, document_type
- **Performance:** No graph traversal overhead

### 4. Metadata & Knowledge Graph
- **Zero-Cost Filtering**: Filter searches by `tag` (u64) with **O(1)** overhead
- **Strict Enforcement**: 100% accuracy without graph traversal penalties
- **Metadata**: Attach optional binary metadata (up to 64KB) per record
- **Knowledge Graph**: Create nodes and edges for complex relationships

### 5. Crash Recovery & Durability
- **WAL & Event Log**: Every operation is synced to disk via length-prefixed logs
- **Batch Ingestion**: Atomic commits for high-throughput bulk inserts
- **Snapshots**: Instant checkpointing and restoration

### 6. Flexible Deployment
- **Embedded (Python FFI):** Link directly into Python for microsecond latency
- **HTTP Server:** Run as standalone node with REST API
- **Bare Metal:** `no_std` compatible for ARM Cortex-M embedded systems
- **Replication:** Leader-follower for read scaling

## 🛠️ Setup

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ (`rustup` recommended)
- Python 3.8+ (for Python bindings, optional)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/varshith-Git/Valori-Kernel.git
   cd Valori-Kernel
   ```

2. **Download benchmark dataset (optional):**
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/download_data.sh
   ./scripts/download_data.sh
   ```

3. **Build and test:**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   cargo test --workspace --exclude valori-embedded
   ```

4. **Run benchmarks:**
   ```bash
   cargo run --release --bin bench_recall
   cargo run --release --bin bench_ingest
   cargo run --release --bin bench_filter
   ```

---

## 📡 HTTP Server (Production Mode)

Run Valori as a standalone node.

**Start Server:**
```bash
cargo run --release -p valori-node
# Server listening on 0.0.0.0:3000
```

**Client Usage:**
```python
from valori import Valori

# Connect to Remote Server
client = Valori(remote="http://localhost:3000")

# Atomic Batch Insert
batch = [[0.1] * 16, [0.2] * 16, [0.3] * 16]
ids = client.insert_batch(batch)
print(f"Batch inserted IDs: {ids}")

# Search
hits = client.search([0.1] * 16, k=1)
```

---

## � Replication & Clustering

Valori supports **Leader-Follower Replication**.

### Running a Leader
```bash
# Default (Leader)
cargo run --release -p valori-node
```

### Running a Follower
Followers stream the WAL/Event Log from the leader and maintain an identical in-memory replica.

```bash
VALORI_REPLICATION_MODE=follower \
VALORI_LEADER_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
VALORI_HTTP_PORT=3001 \
cargo run --release -p valori-node
```

The follower will:
1. **Bootstrap**: Download a snapshot from the leader
2. **Stream**: Replay the WAL/Event Log in real-time
3. **Cross-Check**: Verify state hashes to ensure zero divergence

---

## 📊 Observability

Valori exposes Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`.

**Key Metrics**:
- `valori_events_committed_total`: Total events persisted
- `valori_batch_commit_duration_seconds`: Latency of batch commits
- `valori_replication_lag`: Seconds behind leader (on followers)
