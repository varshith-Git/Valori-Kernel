# Valori Project Code of Conduct

The Valori Kernel is a research–grade deterministic computation project. 
Our work touches systems reliability, reproducibility, and substrate–level
computing research. We welcome discussion, critique, and contributions — but
expect interaction to remain respectful and technically grounded.

## Expected Behavior

Participants are expected to:

- Engage constructively and in good faith
- Critique ideas, not individuals
- Focus on technical accuracy and clarity
- Respect research rigor and empirical evidence

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples include:

- Personal attacks or harassment
- Misrepresentation of technical claims
- Intellectual dishonesty
- Attempts to appropriate or reframe authorship of work

## Research Integrity

Valori maintains strict boundaries between:

- Open–source kernel research and
- Commercial / enterprise extensions

Contributors must respect these licensing and scope boundaries.

## Reporting Issues

If you believe behavior or activity violates this policy, contact the
maintainer privately through the repository issue tracker or project email.

The maintainers reserve the right to remove contributions that threaten the
integrity, safety, or research accuracy of the project.

Thank you for helping maintain a collaborative research environment.
